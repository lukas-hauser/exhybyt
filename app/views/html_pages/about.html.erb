    <h5 class="mt-0">About EXHYBYT</h5>

    <p>EXHYBYT was started by Lukas, a passionate artist himself who is on the mission to make exhibition space more accessible. I organised my own debut exhibition in May 2019 and I found showing work to the public one of the greatest experiences as an artist and photographer. However, finding the right venue and organising the exhibition was difficult, time-consuming and quite expensive.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">I built EXHYBYT to change that. I want to allow many more passionate artists and photographers to share the experience of exhibiting artwork to an audience, but without the hassle and the high cost. I built the platform myself and would love to hear your feedback, if something doesnâ€™t work or if you are missing a feature. You can contact me via lukas@exhybyt.com. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
